                <p>This page is designed to present bits and bobs to help you figure out if Tabletop RPGs are for you...</p>
                <p>There are several different Tabletop RPGs to pick from. from Lovecraftian Mythos, Werewolves, Vampires, Superheroes and Villians, Western... the genres go on and on. One of the more popular roleplaying games is Dungeons & Dragons. Dungeons & Dragons is a fantasy tabletop role-playing game originally designed by Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson.
